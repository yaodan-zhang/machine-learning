### Task:

Clustering on UCI seed dataset, which can be downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds. The number of clusters is set as 3.

You need to:

1. Implement K-means and GMM-EM algorithms from scratch (i.e., no
   third-party or off-the-shelf package or library are allowed). Explain briefly
   your source codes in the report.
2. Implement 2 evaluation metrics including Silhouette Coefficient and
   Rand Index from scratch (i.e., not calling off-the-shelf package) to
   evaluate the performance of above clustering algorithms.
3. Analyze the sensitivity to the initialization of each algorithm (e.g., run
   one clustering algorithm with random initialization multiple times, and
   calculate the standard deviations of evaluation scores of these clustering
   results).
